# RISC-V DIY assembler/compiler

This is a part of the blog post "RISC-V can be fun if they don't mess it up".

## How to run the sample program

 2. Check that you've got `rv-jit` installed.
 3. Run `python sample_hello.py`
 4. `hello` -file is produced.
 5. Run `rv-jit hello`
 6. The program prints `Hello World` to the screen.

## Public notice

The encoding tables and stuff here probably contain bugs
that are revealed if actually used.

I'll probably add other compiler related stuff here later,
but that'll be an another blog post if it ever happens.
